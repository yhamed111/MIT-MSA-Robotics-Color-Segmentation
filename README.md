# MIT-MSA-Robotics-Color-Segmentation
Prerequisites: Make sure you have a git configured on your local machine, if not go back to lecture 1 and follow instructions in the last few slides.

Instructions:

- Press the green Code button at the top of the repo
- Select HTTPS
- Copy the link
- Go to your terminal and clone the repo using: git clone (link)

Note: do not place the brackets around the link

Part 1 is straightforward. Go to color_segmentation_still.py. Most of the code is completed but you'll have the fill in the TODOs. A lot of the lines will be using functions similar to the ones we saw in lecture, so check out the cv2 documentation https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/ and search for any function. Alternatively, you could also google a lot of the functions, which we hope will get across the idea that in programming google is your best friend :)

Part 2
Once you have a working part 1, you can paste that code into color_segmentation_video.py to use color segmentation on your webcam! Run the code and a slider will pop up to adjust the HSV values of the color you want to target. A box will be drawn around the object in real-time!

Submission:
Complete the first portion of color segmentation with the lemon, and once you have a bounding box submit that to the #robotics-assignment channel (will announce when opened)

Extra practice: Once both are working, create your own git repo and push your completed code to it. Post a screenshot into the assignment channel and you'll get a cool reaction emoji :D

Congrats! You just finished your own computer vision project.
